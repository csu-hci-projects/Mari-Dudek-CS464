## Video Game & Social Media Addiction Experiment

### About
This study was conducted in CS464 - Human Computer Interaction, Spring 2021. The goal of the 
experiment is to study potential video game and/ or media addiction in young adults. 
Participants were asked to play a Snake game and then complete a survey about their gaming 
and social media habits. Half of the participants were able to see how long they were playing 
and the other half were not.  

### Experiment Tasks

1. Use arrow keys to move. 
2. If the snake touches the edge or itself, you lose. 
3. You may play for as long as you'd like, and restart as many times as you'd like. 

* Survey Questions:
1. Name
2. Age
3. Roughly how many hours per week do you spend playing video games?
4. Roughly how many hours per week do you spend on social media?
